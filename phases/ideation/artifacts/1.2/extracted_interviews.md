# Interview Tracking Spreadsheet - Karachi Grocery App Extract

## Overview
This document captures problem validation interviews for a hyperlocal real-time grocery availability app in Karachi, conducted November 25 - December 10, 2025 by Shayan Raees.

## Key Metrics
- **12 interviews completed**
- **7.8/10 average pain intensity**
- **83% mentioned workarounds** (10 of 12 respondents)
- **3.9/5 average purchase intent**
- **75% confirmed current spending** on groceries

## Critical Validation Results
All three KPI categories passed thresholds:
- Problem validation: Pain intensity, workarounds, and recency all exceeded targets
- Solution validation: 92% showed interest; 75% would switch from competitors
- Market validation: 75% qualified as buyers (intent 4-5); average weekly spend Rs. 4,525

## Primary Pain Points
Respondents universally cited unpredictable stock availability. Additional challenges included traffic-related delays, inconsistent pricing across stores, and existing delivery app failures.

## Notable Observation
One interviewee stated: "I've wasted 2 hours last week going to 3 different stores because none had fresh eggs." This illustrates the time-cost burden consumers bear.

## Design Partners Identified
Five high-intent candidates expressed willingness to pilot, including a working mother and IT couple, signaling readiness for product testing.
