# Interview Tracking Spreadsheet Summary

## Overview
This document records problem validation interviews for a hyperlocal grocery app targeting Karachi. Conducted November 25 - December 10, 2025 by Shayan Raees, the research included 12 interviews with diverse demographic and geographic profiles.

## Key Findings

**Problem Validation:** All KPI thresholds exceeded. Pain intensity averaged 7.8/10, with 83% describing active workarounds. One respondent noted: "I've wasted 2 hours last week going to 3 different stores because none had fresh eggs."

**Market Readiness:** 75% qualified as likely buyers (intent 4-5 on 5-point scale). Interviewees spend Rs. 1,500-10,000 weekly on groceries, with additional delivery costs averaging Rs. 350/week.

**Core Problems Identified:**
- Unpredictable stock across all 12 interviewees
- Time waste during peak hours (10 mentions)
- Price volatility without transparency (8 mentions)
- Delivery app failures (7 mentions)
- Weather-related disruptions (5 mentions)

**Design Partners:** Five high-intent candidates identified for piloting, including a working mother willing to "pay Rs. 200 per delivery if items arrive within an hour" and an IT couple describing the irony of working from home yet struggling to source groceries efficiently.

**Geographic Insights:** Premium neighborhoods showed higher willingness-to-pay; outlying areas like Korangi lack delivery coverage entirely.
