## Variance Analysis

- **Minimum TAM**: $311.78M USD (Statista - Grocery Delivery only, Pakistan)
- **Maximum TAM**: $1,500M USD (Combined food & grocery delivery, Pakistan)
- **Mean TAM**: $905.89M USD (average of $311.78M and $1,500M for comparable segments)
- **Variance**: 131.0% (calculation: [$1,500M - $311.78M] / $905.89M × 100)
- **Variance Status**: ⚠️ >30% (requires investigation)

**Discrepancy Notes** (variance >30%):

The variance exceeds 30% due to **market definition differences**:

1. **Statista ($311.78M)**: Grocery Delivery segment only - excludes restaurant meal delivery, focuses on grocery/household essentials
2. **Industry Reports ($1.5B)**: Combined "online food and grocery delivery" - includes restaurant meals, prepared food delivery, and grocery delivery

**Reconciliation**:
- If restaurant meal delivery represents ~70-75% of the combined market (typical for South Asian markets per industry patterns), then grocery-only would be $375M-$450M, which aligns closely with Statista's $311.78M estimate
- **Conclusion**: Statista figure ($311.78M) is most credible for **grocery delivery TAM specifically**
- For total addressable market including adjacent food delivery, $1.5B is reasonable upper bound

**Recommended TAM for Analysis**: **$311.78M USD (2025) growing to $568.23M (2030)** - Statista Grocery Delivery segment, as it matches venture's specific market (grocery/household essentials, not restaurant meals)
