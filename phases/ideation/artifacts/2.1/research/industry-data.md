## Variance Analysis

### Pakistan E-commerce Market Estimates:
- **Minimum TAM**: $2.8B (Accio, 2024)
- **Maximum TAM**: $5.0B (Tribune/Government, 2024)
- **Mean TAM**: $3.9B
- **Variance**: [($5.0B - $2.8B) / $3.9B] × 100 = **56.4%**
- **Variance Status**: ⚠️ >30% (requires investigation)

**Discrepancy Notes**:
The 56% variance exists due to **differing market definitions and measurement methodologies**:
1. **Accio ($2.8B)**: Represents measured/tracked e-commerce GMV based on internet users and transaction data
2. **Tribune ($5B)**: Government estimate likely includes broader definition (may include B2B e-commerce, informal/social commerce, and cross-border transactions)
3. Both sources agree on directional growth toward $20B by 2030 (4-7x growth)

### Grocery/Food-Specific Market Estimates:
For the **grocery/food delivery subset** (not total e-commerce):
- **Frozen food market**: $770M (Mordor, 2025) - represents packaged/branded grocery subset
- **Fashion e-commerce**: $949M (ECDB, 2024) - adjacent category showing scale of vertical markets
- **Estimated grocery delivery TAM** (calculated): $400M-$800M (2024) based on:
  - Quick commerce described as "fastest-growing" but emerging category
  - Frozen food ($770M) represents only packaged segment, not fresh produce/kiryana items
  - India quick commerce @ $6-7B with 6x population → Pakistan ~$1-1.5B potential at similar penetration
  - Current penetration likely 30-50% of potential → **$400-$800M actual 2024 TAM**

| Punjab (Lahore metro) | ~12M urban | ~5% | $140-250M | Population proxy |
| Sindh (Karachi metro) | ~16-20M | ~7-8% | $196-400M | Population proxy |
| Islamabad/Rawalpindi | ~5M | ~2% | $56-100M | Population proxy |
