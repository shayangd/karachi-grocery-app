## SOM Calculation Inputs

**Variables for Synthesizer**:

```yaml
total_icp_population: 240,000  # Conservative estimate of working professional households in Karachi
geographic_filter: 100%  # Already Karachi-only
reachability: 80%  # % accessible via mobile app + digital payments
realistic_market_share:
  year_1: 1.0%  # Conservative: 2,400 customers = 9,600-12,000 orders/month @ 4 orders/month
  year_3: 5.0%  # Moderate: 12,000 customers = 48,000-60,000 orders/month
  year_5: 10.0%  # Optimistic: 24,000 customers = 96,000-120,000 orders/month

# ARPU (Annual Revenue Per User)
arpu_annual: PKR 14,400  # 12 months × 12 orders/month × PKR 100 avg delivery fee
# OR
arpu_annual_subscription: PKR 11,988  # PKR 999/month × 12 months
# Blended ARPU (50% delivery fee, 50% subscription): PKR 13,194
```

**SOM Formula** (for synthesizer to apply):
```
SOM = Total ICP × Geographic % × Reachability % × Market Share % × ARPU
```

**Example Calculations**:

**Year 1 (Conservative)**:
```
Total ICP: 240,000 working professional households (Karachi)
Geographic Filter: 100% (already Karachi-only)
Reachability: 80% (via smartphone app + digital payments)
Market Share (Year 1): 1.0%

Reachable ICP = 240,000 × 100% × 80% = 192,000 households
SOM (Year 1) = 192,000 × 1.0% = 1,920 active customers

Revenue Calculation:
- Assume 4 orders/customer/month average (aligned with 3-5x/week shopping frequency)
- Assume PKR 120 average delivery fee per order
- Monthly Revenue = 1,920 customers × 4 orders × PKR 120 = PKR 921,600/month
- Annual Revenue (Year 1) = PKR 11.06M (~$39,500 USD @ 280 PKR/USD)
```

**Year 3 (Moderate Growth)**:
```
Market Share (Year 3): 5.0%
SOM (Year 3) = 192,000 × 5.0% = 9,600 active customers

Revenue Calculation:
- Monthly Revenue = 9,600 customers × 4 orders × PKR 120 = PKR 4.61M/month
- Annual Revenue (Year 3) = PKR 55.3M (~$197,500 USD)
```

**Year 5 (Optimistic - Best Case)**:
```
Market Share (Year 5): 10.0%
SOM (Year 5) = 192,000 × 10.0% = 19,200 active customers

Revenue Calculation:
- Monthly Revenue = 19,200 customers × 4 orders × PKR 120 = PKR 9.22M/month
- Annual Revenue (Year 5) = PKR 110.6M (~$395,000 USD)
```

**Alternative Scenario: Subscription Model (50% adoption)**:
```
Year 3: 9,600 customers × 50% subscription = 4,800 subscribers
Subscription Revenue = 4,800 × PKR 999/month × 12 = PKR 57.5M/year
Transactional Revenue = 4,800 × PKR 120 × 4 orders × 12 = PKR 27.6M/year
Total Revenue (Year 3 Blended) = PKR 85.1M (~$304,000 USD)
```

**Budget Allocation Data**:

### Current Grocery Spend:
- **Average Weekly Grocery Spend**: PKR 4,525 per household (from interview data, Recipe 1.2)
- **Monthly Grocery Spend**: PKR 18,100-19,600 per household
- **Annual Grocery Spend**: PKR 217,000-235,000 per household
- **Budget Trend**: Increasing modestly (inflation-adjusted, 5-7% YoY growth)
- **Price Sensitivity**: **Medium** - Working professionals value time savings over price savings

### Current Delivery Spend (Proven WTP):
- **Competitor Delivery Fees**: PKR 99-299 per order (Daraz, Pandamart, InstaShop)
- **Pandamart Pro Subscription**: PKR 999/month for unlimited free delivery
- **Express Delivery Premium**: PKR 200-500 extra for urgent orders (mentioned in interviews)
- **Fuel + Time Costs (Manual Shopping)**: PKR 300-500/week for multi-store trips + PKR 500-1,000 value for 2-3 hours saved

**Evidence**:
- Interview data: 75% of respondents already paying delivery fees to competitors
- Subscription models validated: Pandamart Pro subscriptions demonstrate WTP for recurring fees
- Time-value arbitrage: Working professionals calculate "If I save 2 hours a week, that's worth PKR 500-1,000 to me"

**Budget by Segment**:
| Segment | Avg Grocery Budget (PKR/month) | Avg Delivery Budget (PKR/month) | WTP for Delivery Fee | WTP for Subscription | Source |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------|
| Working Professionals | 18,000-20,000 | 800-1,200 (4 orders × PKR 200-300) | PKR 150-300/order | PKR 999-1,499/month | Interview data, competitor benchmarks |
| Young Parents | 20,000-25,000 | 1,000-1,500 | PKR 150-300/order | PKR 999-1,499/month | Higher frequency, child needs |
| Students | 8,000-12,000 | 200-400 (mostly CoD, avoid fees) | PKR 50-100/order | Low (<PKR 500/month) | Price-sensitive, lower WTP |

**Pricing Floor**: PKR 99 (competitor baseline - Pandamart, Daraz)
**Pricing Ceiling**: PKR 300+ for express delivery (validated willingness for urgent needs)
**Recommended Pricing**: PKR 149-199 per delivery OR PKR 999/month subscription (competitive with Pandamart Pro)
