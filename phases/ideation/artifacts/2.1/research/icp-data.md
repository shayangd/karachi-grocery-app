## SOM Calculation Inputs

**Variables for Synthesizer**:

```yaml
total_icp_population: 700,000  # Households fitting ICP (mid-point estimate)
addressable_individuals: 1,750,000  # Individuals in target households
geographic_filter: 100%  # Already Karachi-only
reachability: 75%  # % accessible via GTM channels (conservative)
realistic_market_share:
  year_1: 1.0%  # 0.5-2% typical for new entrant
  year_3: 8.0%  # 5-15% aggressive growth
  year_5: 18.0%  # 10-25% best case with strong execution
```

**SOM Formula** (for synthesizer to apply):
```
SOM = Total ICP × Geographic % × Reachability % × Market Share % × ARPU
```

**Example Calculation** (for reference):
```
Total ICP: 700,000 households (Karachi affluent 25-40 age, PKR 150-400K income)
Geographic Filter: 100% (already Karachi urban core)
Reachability: 75% (via social media, referrals, partnerships)

Reachable ICP = 700,000 × 100% × 75% = 525,000 households

SOM (Year 1) = 525,000 × 1.0% = 5,250 customers
SOM (Year 3) = 525,000 × 8.0% = 42,000 customers
SOM (Year 5) = 525,000 × 18.0% = 94,500 customers

If ARPU = Rs. 18,200/year (Rs. 350/week delivery fees × 52 weeks):
→ SOM Revenue (Year 1) = Rs. 95.5M ($340K)
→ SOM Revenue (Year 3) = Rs. 764M ($2.7M)
→ SOM Revenue (Year 5) = Rs. 1.72B ($6.1M)

Alternative ARPU (Subscription model @ Rs. 999/month = Rs. 11,988/year):
→ SOM Revenue (Year 1) = Rs. 63M ($225K)
→ SOM Revenue (Year 3) = Rs. 503M ($1.8M)
→ SOM Revenue (Year 5) = Rs. 1.13B ($4.0M)
```

**Market Share Benchmarks**:
- **Year 1 (0.5-2%)**: Typical for hyperlocal startup with design partner approach
- **Year 3 (5-15%)**: Achievable with strong execution, retention, network effects
- **Year 5 (10-25%)**: Best case scenario with dominant position in 2-3 districts

**Comparable Market Share Data**:
- Pakistan online grocery delivery penetration: 5.1% (2025) → expected 8.5% by 2030
- Daraz (e-commerce leader): ~40-50% market share in Pakistan e-commerce
- PandaMart/InstaShop: Estimated 20-30% combined market share in Karachi grocery delivery

**Existing Players**:

1. **Daraz (Alibaba)**:
   - Market position: Dominant e-commerce platform, 55M+ users (Pakistan-wide)

   - Market position: Quick commerce, grocery delivery
   - Estimated users: 2-3M active in Karachi
   - ICP overlap: 80-90% (direct competitor)

   - Estimated users: 1-2M in Pakistan
