**SOM Formula** (for synthesizer to apply):

```
Step 1: Calculate Reachable ICP
Reachable_ICP = Total_ICP × Geographic_Filter × Reachability

Step 2: Calculate SOM (Customer Count)
SOM_Customers = Reachable_ICP × Market_Share_%

Step 3: Calculate SOM Revenue
SOM_Revenue = SOM_Customers × ARPU_Annual
```

---

**Example Calculation** (Year 1 MVP - DHA/Clifton/Gulshan Focus):

```
Total ICP: 2,000,000 households (Karachi)
Geographic Filter (MVP): 30% (DHA + Clifton + Gulshan = 600,000 HH)
Reachability: 75% (via mobile app + social + paid ads)

Reachable ICP = 2,000,000 × 30% × 75% = 450,000 households

Market Share (Year 1): 1.5%
SOM (Year 1 Customers) = 450,000 × 1.5% = 6,750 active customers

ARPU (Year 1): PKR 18,000/year
SOM Revenue (Year 1) = 6,750 × PKR 18,000 = PKR 121.5 million ($432,000 USD at PKR 281/USD)
```

**Example Calculation** (Year 3 - Full Karachi Expansion):

```
Total ICP: 2,000,000 households (Karachi)
Geographic Filter (Year 3): 100% (Full Karachi coverage)
Reachability: 75%

Reachable ICP = 2,000,000 × 100% × 75% = 1,500,000 households

Market Share (Year 3): 8%
SOM (Year 3 Customers) = 1,500,000 × 8% = 120,000 active customers

ARPU (Year 3): PKR 18,000/year
SOM Revenue (Year 3) = 120,000 × PKR 18,000 = PKR 2.16 billion ($7.7 million USD at PKR 281/USD)
```

**Example Calculation** (Year 5 - Mature Market):

```
Total ICP: 2,000,000 households (Karachi)
Geographic Filter (Year 5): 100% (Full Karachi coverage)
Reachability: 75%

Reachable ICP = 2,000,000 × 100% × 75% = 1,500,000 households

Market Share (Year 5): 15%
SOM (Year 5 Customers) = 1,500,000 × 15% = 225,000 active customers

ARPU (Year 5): PKR 18,000/year
SOM Revenue (Year 5) = 225,000 × PKR 18,000 = PKR 4.05 billion ($14.4 million USD at PKR 281/USD)
```

- **Delivery Fee Acceptance**: High (75% of Recipe 1.2 interviewees already paying competitor delivery fees)

**Budget by Segment**:
| Segment | Avg Monthly Grocery Budget | % Willing to Pay Delivery Fee | Preferred Model | Source |
|---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|--------|

| Homemakers | PKR 15,000-18,000 | 70% | Pay-per-order (price-sensitive) | Recipe 1.2 |

**Pricing Floor**: PKR 99 (competitor baseline - Pandamart/Daraz)
**Pricing Ceiling**: PKR 300+ for express delivery (Recipe 1.2 validation: "acceptable for urgent needs")

### Time-Value Calculation (Working Professionals):
- **Time Saved**: 2 hours/week (Recipe 1.2 average)
- **Time Value**: PKR 500-1,000/week (Recipe 1.2 interviewee quote)
- **Annual Time Savings Value**: PKR 26,000-52,000/year
- **Implication**: Delivery fee (PKR 150-200/order) = **3-6% of time savings value** → Strong ROI for customer
