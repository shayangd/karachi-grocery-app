# Realistic Market Share

  year_1: 1.0%  # Conservative (0.5-2% typical), focusing on Clifton/DHA/Gulshan
  year_3: 8.0%  # Moderate (5-15% aggressive)
  year_5: 15.0%  # Aggressive (10-25% best case)

# Reachable ICP Calculation

# Launch Neighborhood Reachable
reachable_launch_neighborhood: 223,125  # 350K × 85% × 75%
```

**SOM Formula** (for synthesizer to apply):
```
SOM = Total ICP × Geographic % × Smartphone % × Reachability % × Market Share % × ARPU
```

**Example Calculation** (Year 1 - Conservative Launch):
```
Launch Neighborhood ICP: 350,000 households (Clifton, DHA, Gulshan)
Smartphone Penetration: 85%
Channel Reachability: 75%
Market Share (Year 1): 1.0%

Reachable ICP = 350,000 × 85% × 75% = 223,125 households
SOM (Year 1) = 223,125 × 1.0% = 2,231 active customer households

If Average Order Frequency = 4 orders/month (1x per week)
Monthly Orders = 2,231 × 4 = 8,924 orders/month
Annual Orders = 8,924 × 12 = 107,088 orders/year

If ARPU = PKR 1,800 per order (basket + delivery fee)
Annual GMV = 107,088 × PKR 1,800 = PKR 192.8 million (~$685K USD at PKR 281 per USD)
```

**Example Calculation** (Year 3 - Karachi-Wide Expansion):
```
Total Karachi ICP: 1,000,000 households (conservative)
Smartphone Penetration: 85%
Channel Reachability: 75%
Market Share (Year 3): 8.0%

Reachable ICP = 1,000,000 × 85% × 75% = 637,500 households
SOM (Year 3) = 637,500 × 8.0% = 51,000 active customer households

If Average Order Frequency = 4 orders/month
Monthly Orders = 51,000 × 4 = 204,000 orders/month
Annual Orders = 204,000 × 12 = 2.45 million orders/year

If ARPU = PKR 1,800 per order
Annual GMV = 2,448,000 × PKR 1,800 = PKR 4.4 billion (~$15.7M USD)
```

**Example Calculation** (Year 5 - Best Case):
```
Total Karachi ICP: 1,800,000 households (aggressive)
Smartphone Penetration: 90% (increased penetration over 5 years)
Channel Reachability: 85% (improved brand awareness)
Market Share (Year 5): 15.0%

Reachable ICP = 1,800,000 × 90% × 85% = 1,377,000 households
SOM (Year 5) = 1,377,000 × 15.0% = 206,550 active customer households

If Average Order Frequency = 5 orders/month (increased frequency)
Monthly Orders = 206,550 × 5 = 1,032,750 orders/month
Annual Orders = 1,032,750 × 12 = 12.39 million orders/year

If ARPU = PKR 2,000 per order (inflation + larger baskets)
Annual GMV = 12,393,000 × PKR 2,000 = PKR 24.8 billion (~$88M USD)
```

## ICP Clustering Insights

**Geographic Clustering**:
- **60-70% Concentration**: Primary ICP concentrated in Clifton, DHA, Gulshan (300K-430K of 1M households)
- **Implication**: Hyperlocal launch strategy viable - build density in 3 neighborhoods before expanding
- **Network Effects**: High density enables faster delivery, better inventory accuracy, word-of-mouth growth

**Income Clustering**:
- **Q4-Q5 Neighborhoods**: Clifton (80K households), DHA (150K households) = 230K affluent households
- **Q3-Q4 Neighborhoods**: Gulshan-e-Iqbal (200K households) = middle-class segment
- **Implication**: Launch in Q4-Q5 neighborhoods first (higher WTP, lower price sensitivity)

**Behavioral Clustering**:
- **High Shopping Frequency**: 3-5x per week = high LTV potential
- **Peak Hour Shoppers**: 6-9 PM = traffic-aware routing is critical differentiator
- **Competitor App Users**: 75% already trained on delivery apps = low adoption friction
- **Technology Clustering**: 85-90% smartphone penetration in target ICP = mobile-first viable

**Competitor Dissatisfaction Clustering**:
- **75% Switching Intent**: Existing competitor users willing to switch = high acquisition opportunity
- **Trust Barrier**: 50% skeptical about inventory accuracy = MVP must deliver 95%+ accuracy
- **Inventory Accuracy Failures**: Universal pain point (100% mentioned) = core value proposition validated
