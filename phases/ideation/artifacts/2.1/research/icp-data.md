```

### SOM Formula (for synthesizer to apply)

```
SOM = Reachable ICP × Market Share % × ARPU

Phase 1 (Year 1):
Reachable ICP = 28,000 households (Phase 1) × 85% reachability = 23,800 households
SOM (Year 1) = 23,800 × 2% market share × Rs. 30,720 ARPU = Rs. 14.6M (~$51K USD)

Phase 1 (Year 3):
SOM (Year 3) = 23,800 × 10% market share × Rs. 30,720 ARPU = Rs. 73.1M (~$256K USD)

Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Year 5):
Reachable ICP (Both Phases) = (28,000 + 16,250) × 80% = 35,400 households
SOM (Year 5) = 35,400 × 20% market share × Rs. 30,720 ARPU = Rs. 217.5M (~$763K USD)
```

### Example Calculation (for reference)

**Year 1 (Phase 1 Launch - High-Value Neighborhoods)**:
```
Total Phase 1 ICP: 28,000 households (DHA, Clifton, Gulshan, Bahadurabad, Johar, PECHS)
Reachability: 85% (high smartphone, tech adoption)
Reachable ICP: 28,000 × 85% = 23,800 households
Market Share (Year 1): 2% (conservative, early adopters)
Customers: 23,800 × 2% = 476 customers

Revenue Calculation:
- Average Grocery Spend: Rs. 18,000/month/household
- Platform Commission: 12% = Rs. 2,160/month
- Delivery Fees: Rs. 400/month (4 orders × Rs. 100/delivery)
- ARPU: Rs. 2,560/month = Rs. 30,720/year

SOM (Year 1 Revenue): 476 customers × Rs. 30,720/year = Rs. 14.6M (~$51K USD)
```

**Year 3 (Phase 1 Maturity)**:
```
Market Share (Year 3): 10% (strong product-market fit, scaling operations)
Customers: 23,800 × 10% = 2,380 customers
SOM (Year 3 Revenue): 2,380 × Rs. 30,720 = Rs. 73.1M (~$256K USD)
```

**Year 5 (Phase 1 + Phase 2 Expansion)**:
```
Total ICP (Both Phases): 28,000 + 16,250 = 44,250 households
Reachability: 80% (blended, Phase 2 lower penetration)
Reachable ICP: 44,250 × 80% = 35,400 households
Market Share (Year 5): 20% (mature product, strong brand, network effects)
Customers: 35,400 × 20% = 7,080 customers

SOM (Year 5 Revenue): 7,080 × Rs. 30,720 = Rs. 217.5M (~$763K USD)
```

### Data Gaps

**Identified Gaps**:
1. **Karachi-Specific Income Distribution**:
   - **Gap**: No Karachi-specific income data; used national Pakistan figures (top 10% = 42% income)
   - **Proxy**: Applied national income distribution to Karachi urban population
   - **Flag**: Karachi likely has higher concentration of middle/upper class than national average

2. **Grocery Delivery Market Size in Karachi**:
   - **Gap**: No specific market size for grocery delivery in Karachi
   - **Proxy**: Used Pakistan e-commerce market ($7.7B, 2024) and extrapolated Karachi share (~20-25% of national market)
   - **Flag**: Estimated as $1.5-2B e-commerce in Karachi, ~10-15% grocery (~$150-300M grocery delivery)

3. **Exact Neighborhood Household Counts**:
   - **Gap**: District-level population available, but not neighborhood-level household counts
   - **Proxy**: Estimated based on district population (e.g., DHA ~5-8% of Karachi South, Clifton ~5-7%)
   - **Flag**: Neighborhood estimates are approximations based on area size and density

4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) for Grocery Apps**:
   - **Gap**: No CAC data specific to grocery delivery apps in Pakistan
   - **Proxy**: Used mobile game studio CAC ($1-8/install) and e-commerce benchmarks
   - **Flag**: Actual grocery app CAC may vary; validation needed post-launch

5. **Competitor Market Share (Daraz, PandaMart, foodpanda)**:
   - **Gap**: No public market share data for grocery delivery players in Karachi
   - **Proxy**: Used competitor mentions in interviews (Daraz: 4/12, PandaMart: 3/12, foodpanda: general reference)
   - **Flag**: Market is fragmented; no clear dominant player (opportunity for disruption)
