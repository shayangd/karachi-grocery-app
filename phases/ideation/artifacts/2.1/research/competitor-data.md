**Key Insights**:

4. **Order frequency** is key driver: 40-60 orders/year (active users) vs 12-24 (occasional users)

### ARPU by Segment (Estimated for Pakistan)

| Customer Segment | Orders/Month | AOV ($) | Annual ARPU | Frequency Driver |
|------------------|-------------|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Active Quick-Commerce Users** | 4-5 | $8-10 | $450-600 | Convenience, high income |
| **Regular Users** | 2-3 | $8-10 | $200-360 | Working professionals, families |

## SAM Estimation

### Method 1: Top-Down from TAM

**Calculation**:
```
SAM = TAM × Geographic % × Segment % × Use-Case %
```

**Pakistan E-Commerce TAM (2024)**: **$7.7B** (source: LinkedIn research, 17% CAGR)

**Filters**:
- **Geographic**: 100% (Pakistan-wide, but focus on Karachi)
  - Karachi represents **30-40%** of Pakistan e-commerce
  - Karachi SAM filter: **30%** of TAM
- **Segment (Grocery/Quick-Commerce)**: **5-10%** of e-commerce is grocery delivery
  - Pakistan still early in e-grocery adoption (vs India at 10-15%)
- **Use-Case (Addressable for our solution)**: **60-80%**
  - Our solution targets quick-commerce + kiryana hybrid
  - Excludes: Bulk wholesale (Bazaar), marketplace-only (Daraz non-grocery)

**SAM Estimate (Top-Down)**:
```
Karachi SAM = $7.7B × 30% (Karachi) × 7.5% (grocery) × 70% (use-case)
Karachi SAM = $7.7B × 0.30 × 0.075 × 0.70
Karachi SAM = $121M
```

**Pakistan-Wide SAM**: $400-500M (extrapolating Karachi × 3.5 for national)

---

### Method 2: Bottom-Up from Competitors

**Calculation**:
```
SAM = Σ(Competitor Revenues in addressable segment)
```

**Competitor Revenues in Pakistan Quick-Commerce/Grocery (2024)**:

| Competitor | Estimated Revenue (Pakistan Grocery/Quick-Commerce) |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Daraz Mart | $80-100M (grocery segment of total e-commerce) |
| Foodpanda PandaMart | $50-100M |
| Bazaar (B2C grocery) | $10-20M (excl. B2B wholesale) |
| Krave Mart | $5-15M |
| DealCart | $5-10M |
| Yango Grocery | $5-10M |
| Others (local players) | $20-40M |

**Total SAM (Bottom-Up)**: **$175-295M** (midpoint: **$235M**)

---

### Method 3: India Comparable Extrapolation

**India Quick-Commerce Market (2024)**: **$6-7B GMV**

**Pakistan vs India Adjustments**:
- **Population**: Pakistan 240M / India 1,400M = **17%**
- **GDP per Capita**: Pakistan $1,600 / India $2,600 = **62%**
- **E-Commerce Penetration**: Pakistan 5-7% / India 10-12% = **58%**
- **Urbanization**: Pakistan 37% / India 35% = **106%**

**Blended Adjustment Factor**: 17% × 62% × 58% × 106% = **6.5%**

**Pakistan SAM (India Comparable)**:
```
Pakistan SAM = $6.5B (India GMV) × 6.5% (adjustment)
Pakistan SAM = $422M
```

---

### SAM Cross-Check Summary

| Method | SAM Estimate | Confidence |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Top-Down (Karachi)** | $121M | Moderate |
| **Top-Down (Pakistan)** | $400-500M | Moderate |
| **Bottom-Up (Competitor Revenues)** | $235M | Good |
| **India Comparable** | $422M | Moderate |

**Variance Analysis**:
- **Bottom-up** ($235M) likely **underestimates** true SAM (only tracked competitors, excludes informal market)
- **India comparable** ($422M) may **overestimate** due to India's more mature quick-commerce adoption
- **Top-down** ($400-500M) aligns closely with India comparable

**Recommended SAM Estimate**: **$300-400M** for Pakistan quick-commerce/grocery delivery market (2024)
- **Karachi (target market)**: **$100-150M** (30-35% of national)
