However, the combination of validated differentiation (75% switching intent), healthy unit economics, and precedent for market concentration (Foodpanda 40-50% share) creates a compelling venture-backable opportunity. Multi-city expansion strategy (Karachi + Lahore + Islamabad) provides realistic path to $100M ARR with 15-25% share per city.",
