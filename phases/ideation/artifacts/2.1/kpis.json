Base estimate $400M is below $500M minimum threshold for venture-scale. 82.5% variance due to lack of tier-1 analyst coverage (Gartner/IDC/Forrester do not cover Pakistan market).

Alternative scenarios equally impossible: Low ($50 ARPU) requires 381% share, High ($30 ARPU) requires 635% share. Even $10M ARR requires 48% market share (near-monopoly). Geographic expansion to Pakistan-wide or South Asia mandatory for venture-scale outcomes. Score: 15/100 (UNLIKELY: >100% market share required)."

Mitigation: Used tier-1 regional data (Mordor Intelligence Asia-Pacific $289.24B, Agriculture Canada Indo-Pacific $85.0B, Research and Markets Global $264.94B) then calculated Pakistan subset via triangulation.

ARPU calculated from: AOV $10-15 × 3-5 orders/month × 12 months = $40/year.
