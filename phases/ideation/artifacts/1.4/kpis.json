  "verdict_rationale": "Strong decoupling opportunity with 7.6/10 opportunity score and 5 independent evidence sources. Step 3 (Check Stock Availability) represents a critical weak link with 8.5/10 pain, 3.0/10 incumbent performance, and 5.5-point gap. The step is highly decouplable across all three dimensions (technical, economic, behavioral feasibility all HIGH). Customers already pay Rs. 99-299 in delivery fees and value time savings at Rs. 500-1,000/week, demonstrating strong willingness-to-pay for inventory visibility alone. 83% actively building workarounds (calling stores, multi-store visits), validating behavioral readiness. Recipe 5.1 confirms no competitor offers real-time neighborhood inventory visibility, creating clear white space. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization, architecture mismatch, brand risk) provide 18-24 month competitive window. All conditions for successful decoupling are met: customer pull (severe pain + workarounds), market gap (incumbent weakness + white space), technical feasibility (clean separation), economic viability (proven WTP), and strategic defensibility (structural barriers).",

Pain score of 8.5/10 validated by Recipe 1.2 showing 100% of interviewees cite stock unpredictability as #1 pain, 83% active workarounds, 2+ hours wasted/week. Incumbent weakness of 7.0/10 (inverted from 3.0/10 performance) validated by Recipe 5.1 competitive gap analysis: 'No competitor offers real-time, hyperlocal visibility into neighborhood store stock.' Standalone viability of 9.0/10 reflects HIGH ratings across all three feasibility dimensions: Technical (clean POS API inputs/outputs, no incumbent dependencies), Economic (proven WTP of Rs. 299/month vs. Rs. 500-1,000/week time value, 75% budget confirmation), Behavioral (83% workarounds, 75% multi-app usage, explicit unbundling desire from interviews). Score exceeds 7.0/10 threshold by 8.6%, indicating strong GO signal."

      "evidence": "Identified 5 independent evidence sources supporting decoupling hypothesis, exceeding 3-source threshold by 67%. Source 1 (Interview Quotes): Primary qualitative from Recipe 1.2 - 'I've wasted 2 hours last week going to 3 different stores because none had fresh eggs.' Source 2 (Workaround Behavior): Primary behavioral from Recipe 1.2 I1.2.2 - 83% (10/12) building workarounds (calling stores, multi-store visits, app trial-and-error). Source 3 (Competitive Gap): Secondary intelligence from Recipe 5.1 - professional analysis confirms 'no competitor emphasizes real-time neighborhood inventory visibility' across 8 analyzed players. Source 4 (Competitor Failures): Primary qualitative from Recipe 1.2 Theme 3 - 75% (9/12) report Pandamart/Daraz/InstaShop failures (canceled orders, wrong items, no inventory transparency). Source 5 (Willingness-to-Pay): Primary quantitative from Recipe 1.2 I1.2.7, I1.2.9 - 75% budget confirmation, Rs. 99-299 delivery fees already paid, Rs. 500-1,000/week time-value calculations. Evidence triangulates across qualitative pain (interviews), quantitative behavior (workarounds, WTP), competitive intelligence (gap analysis), and incumbent failures (displacement opportunity). Strong mix of primary (4/5) and secondary (1/5) sources reduces single-point-of-failure risk. Normalized score: (5 sources / 6 maximum sources) × 100 = 83/100."
