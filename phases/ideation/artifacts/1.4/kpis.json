The combination of extreme customer pain (9/10 for inventory availability checking), severe incumbent weakness (2/10 with ZERO of 8 competitors offering real-time neighborhood inventory per Recipe 5.1), and high standalone viability (9/10 across technical, economic, and behavioral dimensions) creates exceptional conditions for strategic decoupling. Step 3 (Check Item Availability) represents the primary weak link with a 7-point pain-performance gap, validated by 100% of interviewees citing this as their #1 pain point. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization from dark store models, architecture mismatch between centralized and distributed systems, operational complexity requiring 95% accuracy, and cultural knowledge gaps) provide 18-24 month competitive window. Capital efficiency of Rs. 400-600K MVD approach dramatically de-risks execution vs. Airlift's $85M failure, while 8-17x customer ROI ensures monetization path at validated Rs. 149-999/month pricing.",
