  "verdict_rationale": "Strong decoupling opportunity with 8.65/10 opportunity score and 6 independent evidence sources. The combination of severe customer pain (9/10 for inventory visibility), weak incumbent performance (2/10), and high standalone viability (9/10 across technical, economic, and behavioral dimensions) creates ideal conditions for strategic decoupling. Primary weak link (real-time inventory visibility) and secondary weak link (traffic-aware routing) can be decoupled together as integrated MVD. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization, architecture mismatch, brand risk, customer segmentation, execution complexity) provide 18-24 month competitive window.",

  "verdict_rationale": "Strong decoupling opportunity with 7.6/10 opportunity score and 5 independent evidence sources. Step 3 (Check Stock Availability) represents a critical weak link with 8.5/10 pain, 3.0/10 incumbent performance, and 5.5-point gap. The step is highly decouplable across all three dimensions (technical, economic, behavioral feasibility all HIGH). Customers already pay Rs. 99-299 in delivery fees and value time savings at Rs. 500-1,000/week, demonstrating strong willingness-to-pay for inventory visibility alone. 83% actively building workarounds (calling stores, multi-store visits), validating behavioral readiness. Recipe 5.1 confirms no competitor offers real-time neighborhood inventory visibility, creating clear white space. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization, architecture mismatch, brand risk) provide 18-24 month competitive window. All conditions for successful decoupling are met: customer pull (severe pain + workarounds), market gap (incumbent weakness + white space), technical feasibility (clean separation), economic viability (proven WTP), and strategic defensibility (structural barriers).",
