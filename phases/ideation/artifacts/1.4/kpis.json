  "verdict_rationale": "The 'Check Availability & Prices' step represents an exceptional decoupling opportunity with a +7 gap score (pain 9/10, incumbent performance 2/10). All three feasibility dimensions are HIGH (technical, economic, behavioral), validated by 100% of interviews mentioning this pain and 83% building workarounds. The 8.65/10 opportunity score significantly exceeds the 7.0 threshold, and 5 independent evidence sources provide high confidence. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization, architecture mismatch, brand conflicts) give MVD an 18-24 month competitive window.",
