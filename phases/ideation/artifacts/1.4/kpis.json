Step 3 'Discover where items are available' represents an exceptional weak link with 9/10 customer pain and 2/10 incumbent performance, creating a 7-point gap. The step is highly decouplable across all three dimensions (technical, economic, behavioral feasibility all rated HIGH). 100% of interviews mentioned inventory unpredictability as critical pain, 83% have active workarounds, and 0/8 competitors solve this problem. Structural barriers (revenue cannibalization, architecture mismatch, brand conflict, customer segmentation gap) provide 18-24 month competitive window.",

Incumbent Weakness=8/10 (performance score 2/10: no real-time visibility from any competitor, static catalogs, frequent cancellations). Standalone Viability=9/10 average (Technical feasibility: 9/10 with clean inputs/outputs, Economic feasibility: 9/10 with Rs 200-500/month WTP validated, Behavioral feasibility: 9/10 with 83% workaround rate proving demand).

Source 2: Workaround prevalence - 83% (10/12) built active solutions (WhatsApp groups, phone calls, spreadsheets, multiple store relationships). Source 3: Competitor failures - All 8 competitors (Daraz, PandaMart, Krave Mart) attempted but failed to solve with frequent cancellations and out-of-stock surprises reported by 58% of users. Source 4: Universal complaint pattern - 100% recognition across all demographics (professionals, homemakers, students, business owners) in 12 interviews. Source 5: Quantified economic impact - Rs 2,000-5,000/month per customer in wasted time (2+ hours/week) and transport (2-3 failed trips/month), totaling Rs 84B/year TAM across 2M Karachi households. Exceeds 60/100 threshold by 23 points."
