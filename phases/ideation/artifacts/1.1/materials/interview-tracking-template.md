---

### Problem Validation Metrics

#### Pain (0-10)
**Question Mapping**: Q3, Q6
**Definition**: How intensely does the interviewee feel the problem?

**Scoring Guide**:
- **10**: Extreme pain, unprompted emotional venting, using words like "hate," "nightmare," "waste"
- **9**: Very strong frustration, very specific examples, measurable negative impact on life
- **8**: Clear frustration with specific stories, articulates cost/time impact
- **7**: Moderate frustration, can describe pain without prompting, seeking solutions
- **6**: Noticeable annoyance, mentions it affects them but not severe
- **5**: Mild inconvenience, acknowledges issue but not urgent
- **4**: Slight bother, struggles to articulate impact
- **3**: Barely noticeable problem, mostly indifferent
- **2**: Hypothetical problem, no real examples
- **1**: No pain, defensive of current situation
- **0**: Completely satisfied, no problem exists

**Red Flags**:
- 🚩 Score <5 suggests low pain, weak validation
- 🚩 Can't give specific examples = hypothetical pain, score conservatively
- 🚩 Generic complaints ("it's annoying") without emotion = score ≤5

**Examples**:
- Pain 9/10: "I literally waste 3 hours every week on this. I've cried from frustration when the store was out of stock after I drove 40 minutes." (Specific, emotional, measurable)
- Pain 6/10: "Yeah, it's annoying sometimes. Like last month I had to go twice because I forgot something." (Vague, infrequent, mild)
- Pain 3/10: "I guess it could be better, but it's fine." (Indifferent, no real pain)

---

#### Workarounds
**Question Mapping**: Q5
**Definition**: Does the interviewee actively do something to cope with or mitigate the problem?

**Format**: Y or N

**Y (Yes)** = They have a specific workaround they actively use:
- ✅ "I order online from 3 different stores to compare prices"
- ✅ "I hired my neighbor's kid to do the shopping for me"
- ✅ "I keep a detailed spreadsheet to track which stores have what"
- ✅ "I only shop at 6am to avoid crowds"

**N (No)** = No active workaround:
- ❌ "I just deal with it"
- ❌ "Nothing I can do about it"
- ❌ "I complain but don't do anything different"

**Why This Matters**: Active workarounds signal real pain + belief the problem is solvable. No workarounds may mean low pain OR they think it's unsolvable.

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.4 (Workaround Activity). Target: ≥60% with workarounds.

---

#### Recency
**Question Mapping**: Q1, Q2, Q8
**Definition**: How recently did they experience this problem?

**Format**: One of three options
- `<7d` = Within the past 7 days (very recent)
- `<30d` = Within the past 30 days but not past week
- `>30d` = More than 30 days ago

**How to Determine**:
- Ask Q1: "Tell me about the LAST time you went grocery shopping"
- If they give a specific recent day ("last Thursday", "two days ago") → **<7d**
- If they struggle to remember exact day but within the month → **<30d**
- If they say "a while ago" or can't recall specifics → **>30d**

**Red Flags**:
- 🚩 >30d suggests infrequent problem or fading pain
- 🚩 Can't remember details = likely >30d, don't inflate

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.1 (Problem Recency). Target: ≥70% with <7d recency.

---

#### Solution Interest (0-10)
**Question Mapping**: Q10, Q11, Q12
**Definition**: How interested are they in YOUR specific solution concept?

**Scoring Guide**:
- **10**: "Where do I sign up? Seriously, I need this now." (Immediate commitment language)
- **9**: "This would solve exactly what I described. When can I try it?" (Clear connection to their pain)
- **8**: "That would really help with [specific problem]. How does [detail] work?" (Engaged, asking clarifying questions)
- **7**: "I'd definitely try that. It sounds better than [current solution]." (Comparative validation)
- **6**: "Sounds useful, I think I'd use it." (Mild interest, non-specific)
- **5**: "Interesting idea." (Polite interest, non-committal)
- **4**: "Maybe, I'd have to see it." (Skeptical)
- **3**: "I'm not sure that solves my problem." (Doubts fit)
- **2**: "I don't think I'd use that." (Low interest)
- **1**: "That's not for me." (Clear rejection)
- **0**: "I wouldn't use that." (Hard no)

**Critical Distinction - Genuine vs Polite Interest**:

**Genuine Interest** (score 7-10):
- ✅ Asks detailed follow-up questions unprompted
- ✅ Connects solution to specific pain they mentioned earlier
- ✅ Uses language like "I need this" not "sounds nice"
- ✅ Short response time (<2 seconds) before positive reaction
- ✅ Leans forward, animated, excited tone

**Polite Interest** (score ≤6):
- 🚩 Generic compliments: "That's a great idea!"
- 🚩 Long pause before responding positively
- 🚩 Doesn't connect to their specific pain
- 🚩 Says "interesting" or "cool" (filler words)
- 🚩 No follow-up questions or curiosity

**Example Dialogue Analysis**:

**High Interest (Score 8-9)**:
> Interviewer: "So it would deliver groceries within 2 hours with guaranteed freshness."
>
> Interviewee: "Wait, 2 hours? Even on weekends? Because the biggest problem I have is Saturday mornings when I realize I'm out of milk and the kids need breakfast. Could I order at 7am and get it by 9am?"
>
> *Analysis: Immediate connection to specific pain, asks detailed logistics question, visualizing usage. Score: 8-9*

**Polite Interest (Score 4-5)**:
> Interviewer: "So it would deliver groceries within 2 hours with guaranteed freshness."
>
> Interviewee: [pause] "Oh, that sounds really nice. Yeah, I think that would be useful."
>
> *Analysis: Pause before response, generic language ("sounds nice"), no specifics. Score: 4-5*

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.5 (Solution Interest Score). Target: Average ≥7/10 across all interviews.

---

#### Displace %
**Question Mapping**: Q13
**Definition**: What percentage of their current shopping behavior would they replace with your solution?

**Format**: Numerical percentage (0-100)

**How to Ask**: "If you started using this, what percentage of your grocery shopping would shift to this vs continuing with [their current method]?"

**Scoring Examples**:
- **100%**: "I'd do all my shopping through this"
- **75%**: "Most of my shopping, but I'd still go in person for fresh meat/fish"
- **50%**: "Half - I'd use it for staples but still shop for produce in person"
- **25%**: "Just for emergency items or things I forgot"
- **10%**: "Maybe occasional use"
- **0%**: "I'd keep doing what I do now"

**Follow-up Probe**: "What would you still do the old way? Why?"

**Red Flags**:
- 🚩 <50% displacement = supplementary solution, not primary
- 🚩 Vague answer = probe for specifics, don't assume high %

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.8 (Competitive Displacement). Target: Average ≥50% displacement.

---

#### Outcome Align
**Question Mapping**: Q9, Q14, Q16, Q20
**Definition**: Does your solution deliver the outcome they actually care about?

**Format**: Y or N

**Y (Yes)** = Solution maps to their desired outcome:
- ✅ They want to save time → your solution demonstrably saves time
- ✅ They want quality/freshness → your solution guarantees quality
- ✅ They want convenience → your solution is more convenient
- ✅ Can articulate how solution improves their life (Q16)

**N (No)** = Misalignment between solution and desired outcome:
- ❌ They want to save money → your solution costs more
- ❌ They want social interaction → your solution is digital-only
- ❌ They want control → your solution removes control
- ❌ Can't articulate benefit in their life (Q16)

**How to Determine**:
1. Note their answer to Q20: "What's more valuable: save time, save money, or improve quality?"
2. Check if your solution actually delivers that value
3. Listen to Q16: "If you used this for 3 months, what would be different?"
   - If they can clearly describe improvement → **Y**
   - If they struggle or describe minimal change → **N**

**Example**:
- They want: "Save time, I'm always rushing"
- Your solution: 2-hour delivery, no shopping trips
- Assessment: **Y** (clear alignment)

vs.

- They want: "Better prices, I'm on a tight budget"
- Your solution: Premium pricing for convenience
- Assessment: **N** (misalignment)

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.7 (Desired Outcome Alignment). Target: ≥80% alignment.

---

### Budget & Pricing Metrics

#### Budget?
**Question Mapping**: Q18, Q19
**Definition**: Do they have budget available to pay for this solution?

**Format**: Y or N

**Y (Yes)** = Clear budget availability:
- ✅ "Yes, I already spend PKR X on [similar service]"
- ✅ "I could reallocate from [specific budget line]"
- ✅ "Money isn't the issue, it's about value"
- ✅ Makes spending decisions independently (doesn't need approval)

**N (No)** = Budget-constrained or unclear:
- ❌ "I'd have to talk to my husband/wife" (not the economic buyer)
- ❌ "Money is tight right now"
- ❌ "I'd have to cut something essential"
- ❌ Long pause or discomfort when discussing payment
- ❌ "I'll think about it" (deflection)

**Critical Distinction**:
- **Budget Available ≠ Willing to Pay**: They might have money but not see the value
- Capture budget availability first, purchase intent separately

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.6 (Budget Availability). Target: ≥60% with available budget.

---

#### Monthly Spend (PKR)
**Question Mapping**: Q17
**Definition**: How much they currently spend on groceries per month.

**Format**: Numerical PKR amount (ballpark estimate is fine)

**Why Capture This**:
- Establishes market size potential
- Shows ability to pay
- Informs pricing strategy (% of current spend)

**Typical Ranges in Karachi** (for context):
- **High-income household**: PKR 50,000 - 100,000+/month
- **Middle-income household**: PKR 20,000 - 50,000/month
- **Budget-conscious**: PKR 10,000 - 20,000/month
- **Single person/student**: PKR 5,000 - 15,000/month
- **Small business**: PKR 100,000 - 500,000+/month

**Note**: If they're uncomfortable with exact numbers, accept ranges.

#### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity (4 Columns)

**Question Mapping**: Q21, Q22, Q23, Q24

These four questions establish optimal pricing range. **MUST collect all 4 data points per interview**.

##### Too Cheap
**Q21**: "At what price per month would you think this is so inexpensive that you'd question its quality?"

**Format**: PKR amount per month

**What This Measures**: Quality floor - below this price, they don't trust it

##### Good Value
**Q22**: "At what price per month would you consider this a good value for the money?"

**Format**: PKR amount per month

**What This Measures**: Lower bound of optimal price - they'd happily pay this

##### Getting Expensive
**Q23**: "At what price per month would you think this is getting expensive, but you'd still consider it?"

**Format**: PKR amount per month

**What This Measures**: Upper bound of optimal price - resistance starts here

##### Too Expensive
**Q24**: "At what price per month would this be so expensive that you would never consider buying it?"

**Format**: PKR amount per month

**What This Measures**: Price ceiling - above this, they walk away

---

**Van Westendorp Validation Rules**:

✅ **Valid Data**: Too Cheap < Good Value < Getting Expensive < Too Expensive

Example: PKR 500 < PKR 1,500 < PKR 3,000 < PKR 5,000

🚩 **Invalid Data** (re-ask questions):
- Good Value > Getting Expensive (illogical)
- Any equal values across different questions
- Too Cheap > Good Value (doesn't make sense)

**What To Do With This Data**:
- After 10-15 interviews, plot all 4 curves
- Optimal price range = intersection of "Good Value" and "Getting Expensive" curves
- The interview-analyzer agent will calculate this automatically

---

#### Purchase Intent (1-5)
**Question Mapping**: Q26
**Definition**: Would they actually pay and sign up if this launched next week?

**Format**: Numerical score 1-5

**Scoring Guide**:

**5 (Strong Yes)**:
- "Yes, where do I sign up?"
- "Put me on the waitlist right now"
- "Can you send me a link?"
- Asks about payment methods, start date
- Uses commitment language: "I will" not "I would"

**4 (Likely Yes)**:
- "Yes, assuming [1 reasonable condition]"
- "Yes, if you cover my area"
- "Yes, once I see reviews from a few people"
- Conditional but condition is achievable

**3 (Tentative)**:
- "Maybe, I'd have to try it first"
- "I'd need to see it / think about it"
- "Probably, but I'm not sure"
- Non-committal, vague

**2 (Unlikely)**:
- "Probably not, but maybe later"
- "I don't think so"
- Deflects: "Send me info and I'll consider"

**1 (No)**:
- "No"
- "Not right now"
- "It's not a priority"
- Polite rejection: "I'll think about it" (after long pause)

---

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Detecting False Positives**

Many interviewees will say "yes" to be polite. **Score conservatively**.

**True Purchase Intent** (Score 4-5):
- ✅ Asks "How do I sign up?" unprompted
- ✅ Asks about payment, delivery areas, start date (logistics questions = real interest)
- ✅ Uses present tense: "I'll sign up" not "I would sign up"
- ✅ Quick response (<2 seconds)
- ✅ Enthusiastic tone

**False Purchase Intent** (Score ≤3):
- 🚩 Long pause before saying "yes"
- 🚩 Uses future conditional: "I would probably..."
- 🚩 No follow-up questions about logistics
- 🚩 Says "send me a link" but doesn't ask when
- 🚩 Compliments idea but doesn't commit: "Great idea! Let me know when it launches."

**Founder Test**:
- After they say "yes," respond: "Great! I'll need your credit card to reserve a spot. Can you provide it now?"
- **If they backtrack** → Score was inflated, reduce to 2-3
- **If they're ready to provide** → Score is legitimate 4-5

**Validation Question**: "What would stop you from signing up right now if I gave you a link?"
- If they list many barriers → Score 2-3
- If they say "nothing" or 1 small barrier → Score 4-5

**KPI Impact**: Feeds I1.9 (Purchase Intent). Target: Average ≥3.0, with at least 20% scoring 4-5.

### Qualitative Data

#### Top 3 Pain Points
**Format**: Bulleted list of their top 3 frustrations **in their own words**

**Example**:
```
1. "Wasting 2 hours every Saturday shopping when I could be with my kids"
2. "Never knowing if stores have stock - I go to 3 different places"
3. "Produce quality is terrible - everything is half-rotten by the time I get it home"
```

**Why Capture This**:
- Validates problem themes across interviews
- Provides quotable insights for pitch/marketing
- Informs solution prioritization

**How to Extract**:
- From Q3 (most frustrating thing)
- From Q6 (magic wand question)
- From spontaneous venting during interview

---

#### Key Quotes
**Format**: 1-3 direct quotes that capture intensity or insight

**What to Capture**:
- Emotional statements ("I hate...", "It drives me crazy...")
- Specific impact statements ("I waste X hours...", "It costs me...")
- Surprising insights
- Objections or concerns

**Example**:
```
"I literally cried last week when I got home and realized I forgot milk after spending 2 hours shopping. I just can't do this anymore."
```

---

#### Notes
**Format**: Free-form observations

**What to Include**:
- Surprising insights or contradictions to assumptions
- Body language / tone observations (if in-person/video)
- Referrals they provided
- Persona fit assessment (did they match the profile?)
- Context that affects interpretation (e.g., "Just had a baby, extra time-constrained")
- Any red flags or concerns about data validity

## After Data Collection

Once you've completed 10-15 interviews and filled this template:

1. **Save this file** to: `/phases/ideation/artifacts/1.1/interviews/interview-data.md`

2. **Export interview transcripts** (or detailed notes) to: `/phases/ideation/artifacts/1.1/interviews/transcripts/interview-01.md` (etc.)

3. **Run the analyzer agent**: The interview-analyzer.md agent will:
   - Read this tracking template
   - Calculate all 10 KPIs
   - Determine GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL outcome
   - Generate the Recipe 1.1 validation artifact

4. **Review results**: Check if your venture passes Problem Validation or needs iteration

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure how to score something:
- **Err on the conservative side** - don't inflate scores
- **Note uncertainty in "Notes" column** for analyzer to review
- **Be honest** - this data determines if you should build this venture

Remember: The goal is TRUTH, not validation of your idea. Bad data → bad decisions → wasted time building the wrong thing.
