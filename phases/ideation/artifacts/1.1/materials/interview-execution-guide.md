**Script**:

> "Hi [Name], thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me today. This should take about 30 minutes.
>
> Just to set context - I'm researching grocery shopping experiences in Karachi. I'm not here to pitch you anything or sell you on an idea. I genuinely want to understand how you shop today, what works, and what frustrates you.
>
> There are no right or wrong answers - I'm just looking for your honest experience.
>
> **Can I record this conversation just for my notes?** I won't share it with anyone, just want to make sure I capture everything accurately. [Wait for consent]
>
> Before we start, do you have any questions for me?"

**If they ask "What's the product?":**
> "I'm still in the research phase trying to understand if there's even a real problem worth solving. I don't have a product yet - that's why your input is so valuable. I promise I'll share what I'm thinking later in the call, but I want to hear your unbiased experience first."

## Section 1: Problem Discovery (20 minutes)

**Goal**: Understand current behavior, pain points, frequency, and severity WITHOUT mentioning your solution.

---

- "How did you get everything home?"
- "How much did you spend roughly?"

**Red Flags to Listen For**:
- 🚩 Can't remember specific details (suggests infrequent activity)

## The Mom Test Reminders

### During the Interview

✅ **DO**:
- Ask about specific past experiences: "Tell me about the last time..."
- Listen for pain in their voice and words
- Dig into the details: "How long did that take?" "How much did you spend?"
- Ask about current behavior: "What do you do today when..."
- Stay quiet and let them think
- Follow interesting threads even if not on script

❌ **DON'T**:
- Ask hypothetical questions: "Would you use...?"
- Pitch your solution before understanding their problem
- Lead the witness: "Don't you think X is frustrating?"
- Talk more than they do

- Defend your idea when they criticize it

### Red Flags You're Breaking The Mom Test

🚩 They're complimenting your idea a lot ("That's brilliant!")
🚩 You're talking more than they are
🚩 They're giving vague answers ("Yeah, that's annoying")
🚩 You're defending your solution when they raise concerns
🚩 You haven't asked about their last actual experience

### Green Flags You're Doing It Right

✅ They're sharing specific stories with details

### Field Definitions

**Pain Score (0-10)**: How intensely they feel the problem (ask directly + infer from emotion)
- 9-10: Extreme pain, unprompted venting, emotional
- 7-8: Clear frustration, specific examples, measurable impact
- 5-6: Moderate annoyance, but not urgent
- 3-4: Mild inconvenience, hard to articulate
- 0-2: No real pain, hypothetical problem

**Workarounds**: Do they actively do something to cope with the problem?
- Y = Yes (specific workaround they do regularly)
- N = No (just accept the pain)

**Problem Recency**: When did they last experience this problem?
- <7d = Within past week (recent, active problem)
- <30d = Within past month (regular problem)
- >30d = More than a month ago (infrequent or fading memory)

**Solution Interest (0-10)**: How interested are they in YOUR solution concept?
- 9-10: "Where do I sign up?", asks detailed questions, genuine excitement
- 7-8: "That would really help", can articulate specific benefits
- 5-6: "Sounds interesting", polite interest
- 3-4: "Maybe", non-committal
- 0-2: "Not for me" or clearly disinterested

**Displacement %**: What % of current solution would they replace?
- 100% = Full replacement
- 50-99% = Primary solution
- 20-49% = Supplementary solution
- <20% = Occasional use only

**Outcome Align**: Does solution deliver outcome they care about?
- Y = Solution clearly maps to desired outcome
- N = Solution doesn't match what they want to achieve

**Budget Available**: Do they have money to pay for this?
- Y = Clear budget, already spending on alternatives or can reallocate
- N = No budget, money is tight, would have to cut something else essential

**Van Westendorp Pricing**: Record exact PKR amounts for all 4 price points

**Purchase Intent (1-5)**:
- 5 = "Yes, where do I sign up?"
- 4 = "Yes, if [1 reasonable condition]"
- 3 = "Maybe, I'd need to..."
- 2 = "Probably not"
- 1 = "No" or polite deflection

**Top 3 Pain Points**: List their specific top frustrations (in their words)

**Notes**: Any surprising insights, quotes, referrals, or context

| I1.1 | Problem Recency | Q1, Q2, Q8 + Tracking field | % with problem <7 days |
| I1.2 | Pain Intensity | Q3, Q6 + Tracking field "Pain Score" | Average pain score across interviews |
| I1.3 | Active Search Behavior | Q8 (venting, searching online) | % who actively searched/discussed |
| I1.4 | Workaround Activity | Q5 + Tracking field "Workarounds" | % with active workarounds |
| I1.5 | Solution Interest Score | Q10, Q11, Q12 + Tracking field "Solution Interest" | Average solution interest score |
| I1.6 | Budget Availability | Q17, Q18, Q19 + Tracking field "Budget Available?" | % with confirmed budget |
| I1.7 | Desired Outcome Alignment | Q9, Q14, Q16, Q20 + Tracking field "Outcome Align" | % where solution matches desired outcome |
| I1.8 | Competitive Displacement | Q4, Q13 + Tracking field "Displacement %" | Average % displacement across interviews |
| I1.9 | Purchase Intent | Q26 + Tracking field "Purchase Intent" | Average purchase intent score |

## Quality Checklist

Before submitting interviews for analysis, verify:

- [ ] **10-15 interviews completed** (minimum 10 for statistical validity)
- [ ] **Persona distribution met** (at least 2 personas represented)
- [ ] **All 27 questions asked** (or majority - OK to skip if redundant)
- [ ] **Tracking template filled** for every interview
- [ ] **Van Westendorp pricing recorded** for all 4 price points per interview
- [ ] **Direct quotes captured** for top pain points
- [ ] **Specific examples documented** (not vague generalizations)
- [ ] **Purchase intent honestly assessed** (not inflated due to politeness)
- [ ] **Notes include surprises** or contradictions to your assumptions

## Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: The Politeness Trap
**Problem**: Interviewees say nice things about your idea to be polite.
**Solution**:
- Ask about past behavior, not future intentions
- Listen for vague vs specific language
- Watch for long pauses before positive responses
- Ask: "What would make you NOT use this?"

### Pitfall 2: Talking Too Much
**Problem**: You pitch instead of listen.
**Solution**:
- Set a timer - if you talk >30% of the time, you're pitching
- Write down your thoughts instead of saying them
- Use silence - wait 5 seconds after they stop talking

### Pitfall 3: Confirmation Bias
**Problem**: Only hearing what confirms your idea.
**Solution**:
- Actively listen for contradictions
- Ask: "Why wouldn't this work?"
- Note surprises and challenges explicitly

### Pitfall 4: Hypothetical Questions
**Problem**: Asking "Would you...?" instead of "When did you...?"
**Solution**:
- Rephrase: "Would you use X?" → "Tell me about the last time you needed X"
- Focus on past behavior, not future predictions

### Pitfall 5: Fishing for Features
**Problem**: Asking what features they want.
**Solution**:
- Ask about their current workflow and pain points
- Let them describe the outcome, not the solution
- Features come from patterns, not feature requests

## After Interviews: Next Steps

1. **Complete tracking template** for all interviews
2. **Export tracking data** to `/phases/ideation/artifacts/1.1/interviews/interview-data.md`
3. **Include interview transcripts** (or detailed notes) in `/phases/ideation/artifacts/1.1/interviews/transcripts/`
4. **Run analysis agent** (interview-analyzer.md) to calculate KPIs
5. **Review KPI results** to determine GO/NO-GO/CONDITIONAL outcome
6. **Iterate if CONDITIONAL**: Refine solution and re-interview if needed
