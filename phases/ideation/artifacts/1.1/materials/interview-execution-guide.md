# Interview Execution Guide - Recipe 1.1
## Problem Validation Interview Prep: Karachi Grocery App

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-11
**Version**: 1.0
**Target**: 10-15 customer discovery interviews
**Methodology**: The Mom Test

---

## Overview

### Venture Context Summary

**Problem**: Karachi citizens struggle with inconsistent grocery availability, rising prices, traffic congestion, and unpredictable store timings, making basic grocery shopping exhausting and time-consuming. This affects working families, students, and professionals who need to shop frequently (3-5 times per week) but face traffic bottlenecks, delivery delays, and out-of-stock frustrations.

**Solution**: A hyperlocal, real-time grocery availability app that shows live inventory from neighborhood kiryana stores, minimarts, and vendors with traffic-aware delivery routing for 30-45 minute delivery. Unlike competitors (Daraz Mart, PandaMart), the app provides real-time neighborhood store inventory visibility AND dynamic delivery estimates based on actual Karachi traffic conditions.

**Current Alternatives**: Daraz Mart, PandaMart, physical kiryana stores, large supermarkets (Imtiaz, Carrefour)

### Interview Goals and Success Criteria

**Primary Goals**:
1. Validate problem severity and frequency (Pain Score ≥7/10 for 70%+ interviews)
2. Confirm recent, recurring problem occurrence (within last 7 days for 80%+ interviews)
3. Identify existing workarounds and current spend
4. Assess solution resonance and willingness to switch
5. Establish willingness-to-pay range for pricing strategy

**Success Criteria (Recipe 1.1 KPIs)**:
- **I1.1 Pain Score**: ≥7/10 for 70%+ interviews (strong problem)
- **I1.2 Recency**: 80%+ experienced problem in last 7 days

- **I1.8 Current Spend**: Median monthly spend ≥ $30

### Q26: On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is "definitely would not buy" and 5 is "definitely would buy", how likely are you to use this service if it launched at [optimal price point from Q21-Q24]?

**Purpose**: Quantify purchase intent (KPI I1.10)

**Probing Questions**:
- What would move you from [current number] to a 5?
- What's holding you back from a higher number?
- What would need to happen for you to try it in the first month?

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Score of 1-2 (unlikely to convert)

- ❌ Conditional on features outside MVP scope

**Scoring Notes**:
- Record exact number
- Conditions for increasing score
- Timeline to first purchase

### Q27: If this launched in the next month and you tried it once, what would determine whether you use it again? What would make you a regular user versus a one-time trier?

**Purpose**: Understand retention drivers, post-purchase satisfaction criteria

**Probing Questions**:

- How many times would you try it before deciding?

**Retention Drivers to Listen For**:
- Delivery time accuracy

- Product quality
- App usability
- Customer service
- Price competitiveness

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ Unrealistic perfection expectations

## Closing (3 minutes)

"This has been incredibly valuable - thank you so much for your time and honesty. A couple of final questions..."

**Ask for Referrals:**
"Do you know 1-2 other people in Karachi who struggle with similar grocery shopping challenges? Would you be comfortable introducing me?"

**Clarify Incentive:**
"As a thank you, I'll send you [PKR 500 Foodpanda voucher / early access link / findings report] within the next few days."

**Permission for Follow-up:**
"Would it be okay to reach out if I have a quick follow-up question? Or if we actually build this, would you like to be involved in early testing?"

**Express Gratitude:**
"Thanks again - your insights are going to be really helpful in shaping this. I really appreciate your time!"

## The Mom Test Reminders

### Core Principles to Follow

1. **Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea**
   - ❌ Bad: "Would you use an app that shows real-time inventory?"
   - ✅ Good: "Tell me about the last time a store didn't have what you needed."

2. **Ask About Specifics in the Past, Not Hypotheticals**
   - ❌ Bad: "How often do you shop for groceries?"
   - ✅ Good: "When was the last time you bought groceries? Walk me through it."

3. **Listen More Than You Talk**
   - Target: 70% them talking, 30% you asking
   - Use silence - let them fill it
   - Probing questions, not leading questions

4. **Don't Pitch, Don't Convince**
   - You're learning, not selling
   - Present solution concept neutrally
   - Listen for genuine resonance, not politeness

5. **Dig Into Emotions and Specifics**
   - "How did that make you feel?"
   - "What did you do next?"
   - "Why was that frustrating?"

6. **Watch for Compliments - They're Lies**
   - "This is a great idea!" = Politeness, not data
   - Redirect: "Thanks! Tell me about the last time you faced [problem]..."

7. **Anchor on Behavior, Not Opinions**
   - Opinions are cheap, behavior is real
   - Past actions predict future actions
   - Current spend indicates willingness to pay

8. **Embrace Bad News**
   - Negative feedback is more valuable than positive
   - Indifference is worse than hatred
   - If they're not excited, that's important data

### Phrase Substitutions

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use Instead |
|---------|---------------|
| "Would you use this?" | "Tell me about the last time [problem occurred]" |
| "How much would you pay?" | "What do you currently spend on [solution]?" |
| "What features do you want?" | "What frustrates you about [current solution]?" |
| "Do you like this idea?" | "How do you currently handle [problem]?" |
| "Would you buy this?" | "Show me your receipt from [current solution]" |

### Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **Generic Praise**
- "This sounds really cool!"
- "I'd definitely use this"
- "Great idea, best of luck!"

🚩 **Hypothetical Future Talk**
- "I would probably..."
- "I think I'd..."
- "In the future I might..."

🚩 **Feature Requests Without Context**
- Long wish lists
- "You should add [feature X]"
- No mention of current pain or workarounds

🚩 **Avoidance of Money Talk**
- Deflects pricing questions
- "It depends"
- Can't articulate current spend

### Good Signs to Look For

✅ **Specific Recent Stories**
- Exact dates/times
- Emotional detail
- Concrete actions taken

✅ **Active Workarounds**
- Currently spending time/money to solve
- Multiple attempted solutions
- Tolerance pain suggests high willingness to pay

✅ **Unprompted Urgency**
- "When will this be available?"
- "Can I beta test?"
- "Let me know when it launches"

✅ **Referral Offers**
- "You should talk to [friend]"
- "I know 5 people with this problem"
- Offers to introduce you

### Interview Anti-Patterns

❌ **The Pitch Trap**
- Spending more than 2 minutes describing solution
- Trying to convince them it's a good idea
- Defending against criticism

❌ **The Idea Validation Trap**
- Asking if they like your idea
- Seeking confirmation bias
- Ignoring negative signals

❌ **The Feature Trap**
- Getting lost in feature discussion
- Building their wish list instead of solving root problem
- Asking what features they want before confirming problem

❌ **The Compliment Trap**
- Taking "great idea!" as validation
- Not digging past politeness
- Ending interview on high note without hard data

### Recovery Phrases

When you catch yourself in a bad pattern:

**If you're pitching:**
"Actually, let me stop there - I'm more interested in understanding your situation. Tell me about..."

**If they're being too nice:**
"I appreciate that! But honestly, I need your critical feedback. What concerns you about this?"

**If it's too hypothetical:**
"Let's focus on what you actually do now. Tell me about the last time..."

**If you're getting wish lists:**
"That's interesting - why is that feature important? What problem would it solve for you?"
