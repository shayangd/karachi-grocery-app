# Interview Execution Guide - Recipe 1.1
## Problem Validation Interviews for Karachi Grocery App

---

## Overview

### Venture Context
**Problem**: Karachi citizens (10-12 million grocery shoppers) struggle with inconsistent grocery availability, rising prices, traffic congestion, and unpredictable store timings. The problem is especially acute for working professionals, university students, housewives, and small families who shop 3-5 times per week, making grocery shopping exhausting and time-consuming during peak hours or bad weather. Delivery delays due to traffic bottlenecks, road blocks, and rain-related issues compound the stress.

**Solution**: A hyperlocal, real-time grocery availability app partnering with neighborhood kiryana stores, minimarts, and fruit/vegetable vendors to show live inventory of essential items currently in stock. Features include dynamic delivery time estimates based on real-time traffic conditions and traffic-aware routing that avoids jammed areas and rain-affected roads. Target delivery: 30-45 minutes.

**Key Differentiators**: Real-time neighborhood store inventory + traffic-aware delivery routing (competitors don't offer this combination)

### Interview Goals
- **Primary Goal**: Validate that grocery shopping pain is severe enough (≥7/10) and recent enough (≤7 days) to drive adoption
- **Secondary Goals**:
  - Confirm solution resonates and displaces current workarounds
  - Establish willingness to pay that supports unit economics
  - Identify strongest persona(s) for initial market entry

### Success Criteria (Recipe 1.1 KPIs)
- **I1.1 Pain Intensity**: ≥60% report pain ≥7/10
- **I1.2 Recency**: ≥60% experienced problem in last 7 days
- **I1.3 Active Workarounds**: ≥50% currently using workarounds (validates need)
- **I1.4 Solution Resonance**: ≥50% express strong interest without prompting
- **I1.5 Competitive Displacement**: ≥40% would switch from current solution
- **I1.6 Outcome Alignment**: ≥60% confirm solution delivers desired outcomes
- **I1.7 Purchase Intent**: ≥40% score 4-5/5 on purchase likelihood
- **I1.8 Budget Availability**: ≥60% have budget or can reallocate
- **I1.9 Pricing Acceptability**: Van Westendorp analysis finds viable price range
- **I1.10 Problem-Market Fit**: ≥70% meet pain + recency + workaround criteria

**Target**: 10-15 interviews across 4 personas

[Get consent, start recording if agreed]

"Let's dive in!"

## Section 1: Problem Discovery (Q1-Q8, ~20 minutes)
**Goal**: Validate pain intensity, recency, and workaround behavior without mentioning your solution

---

### Q1: Can you walk me through the last time you went grocery shopping or ordered groceries? What happened?
**Purpose**: Establishes recency (I1.2) and gets specific, real examples (not hypothetical)

**Probing Questions**:
- When was this exactly? (note the date/days ago)
- What did you need to buy?
- What time of day was it?
- How did it go?

**Listen for**:
- Timeframe (≤7 days is ideal)
- Specific pain points emerging naturally
- Emotional cues (frustration, exhaustion, stress)

**Red Flags**:
- "I don't really shop that often" (low frequency = low priority)
- Vague answers without specifics (may be being polite)

---

### Q2: What was frustrating or difficult about that experience?
**Purpose**: Pain intensity discovery (I1.1) - let them name the pain in their own words

**Probing Questions**:
- What took longer than you expected?
- Did anything go wrong?
- How did that make you feel?
- Did this surprise you, or is this typical?

**Listen for**:
- Multiple pain points (compounding frustration)
- Intensity of language ("exhausting," "nightmare," "waste of time")
- Resignation ("it's always like this")

**Red Flags**:
- "It was fine" or minimal complaint (pain may not be severe)
- Blaming self rather than system ("I should have planned better")

---

### Q3: How often does this kind of frustration happen when you're grocery shopping?
**Purpose**: Validates problem frequency and consistency (I1.2)

**Probing Questions**:

- What percentage of your grocery trips have issues?
- Has it gotten worse or better over time?

**Listen for**:
- "Every time," "almost always," "at least weekly"
- Pattern recognition (e.g., "especially during monsoon," "every evening rush")
- Trend over time (getting worse = stronger pain)

**Red Flags**:
- "Rarely" or "only occasionally" (not consistent enough)
- "Used to be bad but it's better now" (problem may be resolving)

---

### Q4: On a scale of 0-10, where 0 is "no problem at all" and 10 is "extremely painful/urgent problem," how would you rate the severity of your grocery shopping challenges?
**Purpose**: Direct measurement of pain intensity (I1.1 - need ≥7/10)

**Probing Questions**:
- Why did you choose [number]?
- What would make it a 10?
- What's the worst part that drives that number up?
- Has it always been this bad, or has something changed?

**Listen for**:
- Score ≥7 with immediate, confident answer
- Specific examples justifying the score
- Multiple factors contributing to high score

**Red Flags**:
- Score <7 (insufficient pain)
- Long pause before answering (may be inflating to be nice)
- "It's not that bad, really" (contradicts score)

---

### Q5: When you face these grocery shopping problems, what do you currently do to deal with them?
**Purpose**: Identify active workarounds (I1.3 - need ≥50% with workarounds)

**Probing Questions**:
- Walk me through your current process step by step
- What tools, apps, or services do you use?
- Do you call ahead? Order online? Ask someone else to go?
- How much time/money does this workaround cost you?

**Listen for**:
- Active, ongoing workarounds (not just "I deal with it")
- Multiple workaround strategies tried
- Costs associated with workarounds (time, money, mental energy)
- Frustration with current workarounds

**Red Flags**:
- "I just accept it" (no active workaround = lower pain or learned helplessness)
- "I don't do anything" (may indicate low priority problem)

---

### Q6: Have you tried any delivery services or apps for groceries? Tell me about that experience.
**Purpose**: Understand competitive landscape and displacement potential (I1.5)

**Probing Questions**:
- Which ones have you tried? (Daraz, Pandamart, InstaShop, Airlift, local services)
- What did you like or dislike?
- Do you still use them? Why or why not?
- What made you stop (if applicable)?
- What's missing from these services?

**Listen for**:
- Active current usage (need to displace) vs. past trial (easier to win back)
- Specific pain points with existing solutions
- Unmet needs or gaps
- Switching barriers or reasons they stopped

**Red Flags**:
- "I love [competitor] and it's perfect" (hard to displace)
- "I tried once years ago" (not a real competitor user)

---

### Q7: Tell me about a time when you couldn't get groceries when you needed them. What happened?
**Purpose**: Captures emotional peak pain moments and consequences (I1.1, I1.2)

**Probing Questions**:
- When was this?
- What did you need?
- Why couldn't you get it?

- How did this impact your day/family?

**Listen for**:
- Recent, specific story (not hypothetical)
- Real consequences (missed meal, wasted time, family frustration)
- Emotional impact (stress, guilt, anger)
- Unpredictability causing chaos

**Red Flags**:
- "Can't really remember" (not memorable = not painful enough)
- Hypothetical answer ("If this happened, I would...") instead of real story

---

### Q8: What would have to change about grocery shopping for it to be dramatically better for you?
**Purpose**: Understand desired outcomes before introducing solution (I1.6 baseline)

**Probing Questions**:
- If you had a magic wand, what's the one thing you'd fix?
- What does "better" look like specifically?
- How much time would you want to save?
- What would you do with that saved time?

**Listen for**:
- Outcomes that align with your solution (reliability, speed, inventory visibility, traffic avoidance)
- Willingness to articulate clear desired state
- Multiple outcome needs (compound value)

**Red Flags**:
- "Nothing really, it's fine" (contradicts earlier pain)
- Desired outcomes your solution can't deliver (e.g., "free groceries")

---

## Section 2: Solution Exploration (Q9-Q16, ~20 minutes)
**Goal**: Present solution concept and assess resonance, displacement, and outcome alignment

**IMPORTANT**: Before Section 2, introduce the concept neutrally (don't pitch)

"Thank you for sharing all of that. It's really helpful to understand what you're dealing with.

Based on what I'm hearing from folks in Karachi, I've been exploring an idea, and I'd love your honest reaction to it. Remember—there are no wrong answers. If it sounds terrible, please tell me!

**Concept**: Imagine an app that partners with your neighborhood kiryana stores, minimarts, and fruit/veggie vendors to show you what's actually in stock *right now*. You could see live inventory, compare prices across nearby stores, and get delivery in 30-45 minutes. The app would also give you real-time delivery estimates based on traffic conditions and route around jammed roads or rain-affected areas.

What's your immediate reaction to that?"

[Let them respond naturally before asking follow-up questions]

---

### Q9: What's your first reaction to this concept? (Open-ended)
**Purpose**: Captures unfiltered resonance without leading (I1.4 - need strong interest)

**Probing Questions**:

- What sounds appealing?
- What sounds concerning or confusing?
- How does this compare to what you do today?

**Listen for**:
- Spontaneous enthusiasm ("This would be amazing!")
- Specific feature callouts ("Real-time inventory would save me so much!")
- Critical questions that show genuine engagement
- Silence or lukewarm response (red flag)

**Red Flags**:
- "That's nice" (polite but not enthusiastic)
- No follow-up questions or curiosity
- Immediate objections that kill the concept ("I would never use an app for this")

---

### Q10: Would this solve the problems you described earlier? Why or why not?
**Purpose**: Direct outcome alignment test (I1.6 - need ≥60% confirmation)

**Probing Questions**:
- Which of your frustrations would this address?
- Which problems would still exist?
- Is there anything missing that you'd need?

**Listen for**:
- Clear connection between their earlier pain and solution benefits
- Multiple pain points addressed
- Honesty about gaps (shows they're thinking critically)

**Red Flags**:
- "Maybe" or vague answer (weak outcome alignment)
- "It wouldn't really help with my main issue"
- Forcing a connection that isn't there

---

### Q11: Thinking about the services or methods you currently use, would this replace any of them? Which ones?
**Purpose**: Competitive displacement assessment (I1.5 - need ≥40% would switch)

**Probing Questions**:
- Would you stop using [current app/service] if this existed?
- Would this replace going to stores yourself?
- What would you keep doing the same way?
- What would make you switch?

**Listen for**:
- Clear displacement intent ("I'd stop using Pandamart for this")
- Conditions for switching ("If it works reliably, yes")
- Partial displacement (still valuable)

**Red Flags**:
- "I'd keep doing what I do now" (no displacement)
- "Maybe use it occasionally" (not core behavior change)

---

### Q12: What part of this concept is most valuable to you?
**Purpose**: Identifies key value driver for messaging and feature prioritization

**Probing Questions**:
- If you could only have one feature, which would it be?
- Why is that the most important to you?
- How often would you use that feature?

**Listen for**:

**Purpose**: Surfaces objections, risks, and barriers to adoption

**Probing Questions**:
- What would make you skeptical about trying this?
- What could go wrong?
- Why might this not work?
- What would prevent you from using it?

**Listen for**:
- Legitimate execution concerns (vendor adoption, accuracy, reliability)
- Past experiences with failed services
- Specific Karachi context (trust issues, payment concerns)
- Solvable vs. unsolvable objections

**Red Flags**:

**Purpose**: Quantitative interest score (I1.4 resonance + I1.7 purchase intent)

**Probing Questions**:
- Why did you choose [number]?
- What would make it a 5?
- What's holding it back from being higher?

**Listen for**:
- Score of 4-5 (strong interest)
- Specific reasons for the score
- Clear path to increasing score

**Red Flags**:

**Red Flags**:
- "I never pay for delivery" + low pain score (price sensitive segment)
- "Delivery fees are ridiculous" (strong price resistance)

---

### Q19: Is there budget in your household for a service like this, or would you need to shift money from somewhere else?
**Purpose**: Direct budget availability test (I1.8 - need ≥60% with budget)

**Probing Questions**:

**Thank them genuinely:**
"This has been incredibly valuable. Thank you for being so honest and detailed with me. Your insights will really help shape what we build—or whether we should build it at all.

**Next steps:**

- If you're interested, I can share findings once I complete all interviews

**Referral request:**
Do you know 2-3 other people in Karachi who also struggle with grocery shopping who might be willing to chat? I'd be happy to offer them the same thank-you gift, and I'll send you an additional PKR 200 for any successful referrals."

## The Mom Test Reminders

### During Interviews, Always:

✅ **Talk about their life, not your idea**
- Ask about past experiences, not future hypotheticals
- Example: ❌ "Would you use an app that shows real-time inventory?"
- Example: ✅ "Tell me about the last time you went to a store and they didn't have what you needed."

✅ **Ask about specifics in the past**
- Get dates, times, places, emotions
- Example: ❌ "How often do you grocery shop?"
- Example: ✅ "When was the last time you went grocery shopping? Walk me through it."

✅ **Listen more than you talk (70/30 rule)**
- Use silence to let them think and elaborate
- Follow up with "Tell me more about that" instead of introducing new topics
- Resist the urge to explain or defend your idea

✅ **Take their compliments with a grain of salt**
- "That's a great idea!" = politeness, not commitment
- Look for: Specific problems, past behavior, and money talk

✅ **Anchor them in reality, not hypotheticals**
- Example: ❌ "If this existed, would you use it?"
- Example: ✅ "You mentioned you tried Pandamart—are you still using it? Why or why not?"

✅ **Dig into emotional cues**
- When they say something was "frustrating" or "annoying," pause and ask: "Tell me more about that. What exactly happened?"

✅ **Watch for inconsistencies**
- If they say pain is 9/10 but have no workarounds, probe deeper
- If they say "I'd definitely use this" but won't commit to trying it next week, note the gap

### Red Flags That Mean Stop and Probe:

🚩 **Compliments without specifics** → "That sounds great!" (Ask: "What specifically would help?")
🚩 **Hypothetical answers** → "I would probably use it..." (Ask: "Tell me about the last time you tried something similar.")
🚩 **Vague pain** → "Sometimes it's annoying." (Ask: "When was the last time? What happened?")
🚩 **Politeness masking disinterest** → "Yeah, that could be useful." (Ask: "How often would you use this? When?")
🚩 **No follow-up questions** → They're not engaged (Ask: "What concerns you about this?")

2. **Submit raw interview notes** to Interview Analysis Agent
3. **Review KPI dashboard** generated by Analyzer Agent
4. **Identify strongest persona(s)** based on pain + WTP + volume
