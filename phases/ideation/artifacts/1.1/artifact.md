## The Mom Test Principles Embedded

All interview questions follow The Mom Test methodology:

1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
   - Questions focus on past behavior, not hypothetical futures
   - "Tell me about the last time..." vs "Would you use..."

2. **Ask about specifics in the past**
   - Concrete examples required, not generalizations
   - "When exactly did this happen?" vs "How often do you..."

3. **Listen more than talk**
   - 70% listening, 30% talking ratio
   - Probes dig deeper, don't redirect

4. **Don't pitch**
   - Solution presented neutrally for feedback, not persuasion
   - Listen for genuine resonance, not politeness

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. The Politeness Trap
**Problem**: Interviewees say nice things to be polite
**Solution**: Ask about past behavior, listen for vague vs specific language, watch for pauses

### 2. Talking Too Much
**Problem**: You pitch instead of listen
**Solution**: Set timer - if you talk >30% of time, you're pitching

### 3. Confirmation Bias
**Problem**: Only hearing what confirms your idea
**Solution**: Actively listen for contradictions, ask "Why wouldn't this work?"

### 4. Inflating Scores
**Problem**: Recording optimistic scores (all 9-10s)
**Solution**: Be brutally honest - score conservatively, separate genuine from polite interest

### 5. Hypothetical Questions
**Problem**: "Would you use this?"
**Solution**: "Tell me about the last time you needed this"

## Notes

- **The Mom Test is Critical**: Following the methodology ensures valid data - avoid pitching or leading questions
- **Conservative Scoring Matters**: Inflated scores lead to false validation - be brutally honest in tracking template
- **Van Westendorp Requires Precision**: All 4 price points must be collected per interview for valid pricing analysis
- **Minimum 10 Interviews**: Statistical validity requires at least 10 completed interviews, preferably 12-15
