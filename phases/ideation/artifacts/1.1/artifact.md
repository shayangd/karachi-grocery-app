## The Mom Test Principles (Embedded in Script)

✅ **Talk about their life, not your idea**
- Focus on past experiences, not future hypotheticals
- Example: "Tell me about the last time you went grocery shopping" (not "Would you use this app?")

✅ **Ask about specifics in the past**
- Get dates, times, emotions, consequences
- Probe with "When exactly?" "What happened?" "How did that feel?"

✅ **Listen 70%, talk 30%**
- Use silence and "Tell me more" to go deeper
- Resist explaining or defending the solution

✅ **Watch for politeness masking disinterest**
- "That's nice" ≠ purchase intent
- Look for: specific problems, past behavior, money talk

✅ **Anchor in reality**
- Ask about current competitors and actual switching behavior
- Probe inconsistencies (e.g., pain 9/10 but no workarounds)

## Expected Outcomes

### If Validation PASSES (≥7/10 KPIs):
- **Proceed to Recipe 1.2**: Solution Validation with prototypes
- **Focus ICP**: Persona with highest pain + WTP + volume
- **Pricing Strategy**: Use Van Westendorp optimal price point (OPP)
- **Feature Prioritization**: Build most valued features first
- **Beta Tester List**: Invite high-intent interviewees (score 4-5)

### If Validation FAILS (<7/10 KPIs):
- **Pivot ICP**: Shift to different customer segment if one persona passes
- **Pivot Solution**: Modify features/approach based on feedback
- **Pivot Problem**: Re-frame problem based on actual pain discovered
- **Kill Idea**: If fundamental problem doesn't exist or isn't severe enough

### Critical Failure Modes:
- **Low Pain (<60% score ≥7)**: Problem not severe enough to drive adoption
- **No Recency (<60% ≤7 days)**: Problem not frequent/urgent enough
- **No WTP (<40% purchase intent 4-5)**: Can't monetize even if problem exists
- **No Displacement (<40%)**: Existing solutions good enough

## Key Success Factors

1. **Persona Distribution Matters**: Ensure you interview the right mix (P1: 40%, P2: 15%, P3: 15%, P4: 20%)
2. **The Mom Test Discipline**: Don't pitch, don't lead, don't accept politeness as validation
3. **Depth Over Breadth**: Better to have 10 high-quality 25-min interviews than 20 shallow 10-min chats
4. **Real Examples Required**: Every answer should reference specific past behavior, not hypotheticals
5. **Pricing Data Critical**: Van Westendorp analysis only works with complete data from all interviews
6. **Probe Inconsistencies**: If pain is high but no workarounds, dig deeper—something's off
7. **Geographic Focus**: All interviewees must live in Karachi (problem is location-specific)

## Context for Karachi Grocery App

**Problem Being Validated**:
- Inconsistent grocery availability across neighborhood stores
- Traffic congestion making shopping time-consuming (especially 6-9 PM rush)
- Unpredictable store timings and delivery delays
- Rising prices and lack of price transparency
- Weather-related disruptions (monsoon rains)
- Affects 10-12M grocery shoppers in Karachi who shop 3-5x/week

**Solution Hypothesis**:
- Hyperlocal app partnering with kiryana stores, minimarts, fruit/veg vendors
- Real-time inventory visibility (see what's in stock NOW)
- Price comparison across nearby stores
- 30-45 minute delivery with traffic-aware routing
- Avoids jammed roads and rain-affected areas

**Key Differentiators to Validate**:
1. Real-time neighborhood store inventory (competitors don't have this)
2. Traffic-aware delivery routing (Karachi-specific pain point)
3. Hyperlocal focus (neighborhood vendors vs. centralized fulfillment)

**Competitive Landscape**:
- Daraz (e-commerce, slow delivery, no real-time inventory)
- Pandamart (dark stores, limited selection)
- InstaShop (premium pricing, limited coverage)
- Airlift (defunct, but learned from failure)
- Manual shopping at kiryana stores (baseline to displace)
