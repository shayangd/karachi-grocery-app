**Definition**: Percentage of interviewees who are budget holders or can access budget holders for purchasing decisions.

#### Evidence by Interview

| Interview | Profile | Budget Authority | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| #1 | Working Professional, DHA | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 2,500-3,000/week on groceries, I decide what to buy" |
| #2 | Housewife, Gulshan | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 4,000/week household budget, I manage all grocery purchases" |
| #3 | University Student, PECHS | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 1,500/week personal budget, I order my own groceries" |
| #4 | Working Professional, Clifton | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 5,000/week, personal income, no approval needed" |
| #5 | Couple, North Nazimabad | Needs consideration | 50% | "We'd discuss any new service, but price-sensitive" |
| #6 | Working Mother, Bahadurabad | Direct holder | 100% | "I manage household budget, would pay Rs. 200/delivery for reliability" |
| #7 | Bachelor, Shahrah-e-Faisal | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 2,000 groceries + Rs. 3,000 eating out, my money" |
| #8 | Retired, SMCHS | Needs consideration | 50% | "Extended family budget, price-conscious, would need to justify" |
| #9 | Business Owner, Saddar | Direct holder | 100% | "Business expense, full authority, Rs. 10,000/week" |
| #10 | IT Couple, Gulistan-e-Johar | Direct holder | 100% | "Dual income, we decide together, Rs. 4,500/week" |

| #12 | Young Professional, Korangi | Direct holder | 100% | "Rs. 1,800/week, personal budget" |

**Calculation**:
- Direct budget holders: 9/12 × 100% = 75%
- Needs approval (price-sensitive): 3/12 × 50% = 12.5%
- **Total**: 87.5% weighted score, but **75% have direct authority** (primary metric)

#### Analysis

**Strengths**:
- 75% can make independent purchasing decisions without approval
- No corporate procurement processes or lengthy approval chains
- Immediate transaction capability (download app → order → pay)

**Segments by Budget Authority**:

4. **Business Owners** (1/12): 100% direct authority, business expense
5. **Price-Sensitive Households** (3/12): 50% authority (need discussion but have budget)

**Risk Mitigation**: The 25% who need discussion (#5, #8, #11) have documented budgets but are price-conscious. They can be converted through:
- Free delivery for orders >Rs. 1,500 (large basket size)
- Demonstrating time/cost savings vs. current workarounds
- Building trust through early adopter reviews

**Verdict**: **STRONG PASS** — No procurement barriers, immediate purchasing ability, exceeds threshold by 25%.

#### Market Pricing Context

|------------|-------------------|-------|--------|
| **Daraz Mart** | Rs. 49-159 | Distance-based, frequent "free delivery" promotions | Web search, interviews |
| **Foodpanda PandaMart** | Rs. 49-199 | Distance + order size, PandaPro subscription discounts | Web search, interviews |

| **Yango + DealCart** | FREE | Partnership model, 15-20% below rivals claimed | Artifact 5.1 |
| **Krave Mart** | Rs. 50-100 (estimated) | Quick-commerce model (defunct/unreliable per interviews) | Interviews |
| **Bazaar** | Variable | Next-day wholesale model | Artifact 5.1 |

**Market Average**: Rs. 50-150/delivery for standard orders, Rs. 150-200 for premium/fast delivery

**Our Positioning**: Rs. 50-200 (tiered) — **in line with market, win on reliability not price**

#### Analysis

**Why 75% Accept Pricing**:

1. **Value-Based Pricing** (67%, 8/12): Time savings justify cost
   - "If it's faster than going to the store myself (1+ hour with traffic), I'd use it daily" (#10)
   - "I would pay Rs. 200 if certain items arrive within an hour" (#6)

2. **Current Spend Comparison** (58%, 7/12): Already paying similar amounts
   - Rs. 125/delivery average from #1
   - Rs. 300/trip via Careem from #10
   - Rs. 800/week delivery from #6 = Rs. 200/delivery

3. **Reliability Premium** (50%, 6/12): Willing to pay more for service that works
   - "Daraz Mart is slow, if your app delivers in 30-45 minutes with real inventory, I'd switch immediately" (#1)
   - "PandaMart cancelled on me twice, I'd try any reliable alternative" (#3)

**Why 25% Reject Pricing**:

1. **No Current Delivery Spend** (#5): Adjusted lifestyle, not using delivery now
2. **Extended Family Budget** (#8): Large household, price-conscious, tracks spreadsheet
3. **Neighbor Coordination** (#11): Uses bulk purchasing to save costs

**Conversion Strategy for Price-Sensitive 25%**:
- Free delivery for orders >Rs. 1,500 (captures bulk buyers like #8, #11)
- Promotional pricing for first 3 orders (reduces trial friction for #5)
- Subscription model: Rs. 500/month unlimited free delivery (converts frequent users)

#### Pricing Recommendation by Segment

| Segment | % of Market | WTP Range | Pricing Strategy |
|---------|------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Premium (Time > Money)** | 25% | Rs. 150-200+ | Premium 30-min guaranteed delivery at Rs. 150-200 |
| **Standard (Value-Conscious)** | 50% | Rs. 50-150 | Distance-based Rs. 50-100, free >Rs. 1,500 |
| **Budget (Price-Sensitive)** | 25% | Rs. 0-50 | Free delivery >Rs. 1,500, promotional discounts |

**Verdict**: **PASS** — 75% price acceptance exceeds 60% threshold, premium segment (25%) willing to pay Rs. 200+, pricing aligns with market benchmarks.

#### Purchase Intent by Interview

| Interview | 5-Point Scale | 10-Point Scale | Intent Level | Evidence |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| #1 | 4/5 | 8/10 | Strong | "Would likely buy — Daraz is slow, if real inventory and 30-45 min delivery, I'd switch immediately" |
| #2 | 5/5 | 10/10 | Immediate | **"Would definitely buy — During rain season deliveries fail, this would solve that"** |
| #3 | 4/5 | 8/10 | Strong | "Would likely buy — Krave Mart showed item in stock then cancelled, live inventory would prevent that" |
| #4 | 4/5 | 8/10 | Strong | "Would likely buy — Traffic pain is severe, real-time routing would save the trip" |
| #5 | 3/5 | 6/10 | Moderate | "Might buy — Adjusted schedule, depends on pricing" |
| #6 | 5/5 | 10/10 | Immediate | **"Would definitely buy — I would pay Rs. 200 per delivery if I knew items arrive within an hour"** |
| #7 | 4/5 | 8/10 | Strong | "Would likely buy — Ordered from 3 apps last Friday, would consolidate to one reliable app" |
| #8 | 3/5 | 6/10 | Moderate | "Might buy — Price-conscious, would need to see value" |

- **Revenue per order**: Product margin (Rs. 180-450) + Delivery fee (Rs. 50-150) = Rs. 230-600
- **Cost per order**: COGS (Rs. 900-1,350) + Delivery (Rs. 80-120) + Overhead = Rs. 1,000-1,500
- **Contribution Margin**: Highly dependent on AOV and delivery efficiency

### Customer Budget Patterns (from interviews)

## Part 3: Pricing Recommendations

### Recommended Pricing Strategy

#### Tiered Pricing Model

| Tier | Delivery Fee | Speed Promise | Target Segment | % of Market | Expected Adoption |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Standard** | Rs. 50-100 | 45-60 min | Value-conscious, standard delivery | 50% | 6/12 (50%) |
| **Premium** | Rs. 150-200 | 30 min guaranteed | Time-conscious, working professionals | 25% | 3/12 (25%) |
| **Free** | Rs. 0 | 45-60 min | Orders >Rs. 1,500 | 25% | 3/12 (25%) |

**Distance-Based Scaling** (within Standard tier):
- **0-2 km**: Rs. 50
- **2-4 km**: Rs. 75
- **4-6 km**: Rs. 100
- **6+ km**: Not serviced initially (hyperlocal focus)

#### Pricing Rationale

**1. Standard Tier (Rs. 50-100)**:
- **Market Position**: Competitive with Daraz (Rs. 49-159) and Foodpanda (Rs. 49-199)
- **Target**: 50% of customers (#1, #3, #7, #10, #12, plus #4)
- **Win Condition**: Price parity, win on **reliability** (real-time inventory + traffic routing)
- **Profitability**: Covers rider cost (Rs. 80-120) at Rs. 100, loss leader at Rs. 50 (acquisition)

**2. Premium Tier (Rs. 150-200)**:
- **Market Position**: Above market average, justified by speed + reliability guarantee
- **Target**: 25% high-value customers (#6 explicitly stated Rs. 200 WTP, #2, #10 indicated urgency)
- **Win Condition**: "I would pay Rs. 200 if certain items arrive within an hour" (#6)
- **Profitability**: Strong margin, Rs. 30-80 contribution after rider costs

**3. Free Delivery Tier (>Rs. 1,500)**:
- **Market Position**: Competitive with DealCart (free always), Daraz/Foodpanda (free promotions)
- **Target**: 25% price-sensitive + bulk buyers (#5, #8, #11)
- **Win Condition**: Converts price-sensitive segment, increases AOV (Rs. 1,200 → Rs. 1,500+)
- **Profitability**: Loss on delivery, recover via product margins on larger basket

#### Subscription Model (Future Consideration)

**Monthly Subscription**: Rs. 500/month
- **Benefits**: Unlimited free standard delivery (Rs. 50-100 waived)
- **Break-Even**: 5+ orders/month (Rs. 100 × 5 = Rs. 500)
- **Target**: Frequent users (3-4x/week shoppers = 12-16 orders/month)
- **Adoption Projection**: 30-40% of active users after 3 months

**Annual Subscription**: Rs. 4,800/year (Rs. 400/month, 20% discount)
- **Benefits**: Unlimited free standard + 50% off premium delivery
- **Target**: High-frequency, high-value customers

### Competitive Positioning

**Positioning Statement**:
> "Karachi's most reliable grocery delivery app — see live inventory from your neighborhood stores, order with confidence, and receive your groceries in 30-45 minutes with traffic-aware routing. No more wasted trips, no more surprise cancellations."

**Price vs. Value Matrix**:

| Dimension | Our Pricing | Competitor Avg | Our Value | Competitor Value |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Delivery Fee** | Rs. 50-200 | Rs. 49-199 | ✅ Competitive | ✅ Competitive |
| **Inventory Accuracy** | Real-time live | Static/stale | ✅ **SUPERIOR** | ❌ Poor (out-of-stock surprises) |
| **Delivery Reliability** | Traffic-aware routing | Generic routing | ✅ **SUPERIOR** | ❌ Poor (2+ hour delays common) |
| **Speed** | 30-45 min | 30-60 min (claimed), 2+ hrs (actual) | ✅ Competitive | ❌ Unreliable |
| **Transparency** | Live pricing, ETAs | Hidden until checkout | ✅ **SUPERIOR** | ⚠️ Limited |

**Win Strategy**: **Price at market, win on reliability + transparency** — not a race to the bottom on pricing

### Revenue Projections

**Assumptions** (per customer per month):
- **Order Frequency**: 2-4 orders/week = 8-16 orders/month (avg 12)
- **Average Order Value**: Rs. 1,200-1,800 (avg Rs. 1,500)
- **Delivery Fee Revenue**: Rs. 50-200/order (avg Rs. 100 blended)
- **Product Margin**: 15-20% (typical quick-commerce)

**Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) — 12 Month Horizon**:

| Segment | Orders/Mo | AOV | Delivery Fee | Product Margin | Monthly Revenue | Annual LTV |
|---------|-----------|-----|--------------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Premium** | 12 | Rs. 1,800 | Rs. 150 | Rs. 360 | Rs. 6,120 | Rs. 73,440 |
| **Standard** | 10 | Rs. 1,500 | Rs. 75 | Rs. 300 | Rs. 3,750 | Rs. 45,000 |
| **Budget** | 6 | Rs. 1,800 | Rs. 0 | Rs. 360 | Rs. 2,160 | Rs. 25,920 |

**Blended LTV** (25% Premium, 50% Standard, 25% Budget):
- **Blended Monthly**: (Rs. 6,120 × 0.25) + (Rs. 3,750 × 0.50) + (Rs. 2,160 × 0.25) = Rs. 1,530 + Rs. 1,875 + Rs. 540 = **Rs. 3,945/month**
- **Blended Annual LTV**: Rs. 3,945 × 12 = **Rs. 47,340 (~$169 at Rs. 280/USD)**

**Note**: LTV assumes 70% retention over 12 months (typical for food delivery apps)

### Go-to-Market Pricing Strategy

**Phase 1: Launch (Months 1-3)** — Acquisition Focus
- **Pricing**: Standard Rs. 50, Premium Rs. 150 (20% below target)
- **Promotions**: First 3 orders 50% off delivery fee
- **Goal**: Acquire 50-100 early adopters, prove reliability
- **Subsidy**: Rs. 25-75/order loss on delivery (funded by initial capital)

**Phase 2: Growth (Months 4-9)** — Optimize Pricing
- **Pricing**: Standard Rs. 75, Premium Rs. 175 (10% below target)
- **Promotions**: Referral credits (Rs. 100 off for referrer + referee)
- **Goal**: Expand to 200-500 users, achieve unit economics break-even
- **Subsidy**: Rs. 0-25/order loss (approaching profitability)

**Phase 3: Scale (Months 10-18)** — Full Pricing + Subscription
- **Pricing**: Standard Rs. 100, Premium Rs. 200 (target pricing)
- **Promotions**: Launch subscription model (Rs. 500/month unlimited)
- **Goal**: 1,000+ users, 30% on subscription, profitable unit economics
- **Subsidy**: None (profitable per order)
